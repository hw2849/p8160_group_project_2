### Newton-Raphson Algorithm

Newton-Raphson algorithm is a method to search for solutions to the system of equations $\nabla f(\beta_0,\beta)=0$. 
At each step, given the current point $\boldsymbol{\beta}_0$, the gradient $\nabla f(\beta_0,\beta)$ for $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ near $\boldsymbol{\beta}_0$ may be approximated by 

$$
\nabla f(\beta_0,\beta)+\nabla^2 f(\beta_0,\beta)
\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\beta}_{0}\right)
$$

The next step in the algorithm is determined by solving the system of linear equations

$$
\nabla f(\beta_0,\beta)+\nabla^2 f(\beta_0,\beta)\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\beta}_{0}\right)=\mathbf{0}
$$
and the next “current point” is set to be the solution, which is a function of $\beta_0$:

$$
\boldsymbol{\beta}_{1}=\boldsymbol{\beta}_{0}-[\nabla^2 f(\beta_0,\beta)]^{-1} \nabla f(\beta_0,\beta)
$$

The ith step is given by a function of $\beta_{i-1}$:

$$
\boldsymbol{\beta}_{i}=\boldsymbol{\beta}_{i-1}-[\nabla^2 f(\beta_{i-1},\beta)]^{-1} \nabla f(\beta_{i-1},\beta)
$$

The Newton Raphson algorithm iterates through i beta values until the log-likelihood loss has converged. For this project, we uesd an additional half-stepping modiﬁcation to the algorithm to control the number of iteration steps.
